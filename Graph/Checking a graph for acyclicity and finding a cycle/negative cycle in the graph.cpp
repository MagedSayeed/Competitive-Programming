You are given a directed weighted graph

In another formulation of the problem you have to find all pairs of vertices which have a path of arbitrarily small weight between them.

/// Using Floyd-Warshall algorithm

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm allows to solve the second variation of the problem - finding all pairs of vertices  
$(i, j)$  which don't have a shortest path between them (i.e. a path of arbitrarily small weight exists).

Again, the details can be found in the Floyd-Warshall article, and here we describe only its application.

Run Floyd-Warshall algorithm on the graph. Initially  
$d[v][v] = 0$  for each  
$v$ . But after running the algorithm  
$d[v][v]$  will be smaller than  
$0$  if there exists a negative length path from  
$v$  to  
$v$ . We can use this to also find all pairs of vertices that don't have a shortest path between them. We iterate over all pairs of vertices  
$(i, j)$  and for each pair we check whether they have a shortest path between them. To do this try all possibilities for an intermediate vertex  
$t$ .  
$(i, j)$  doesn't have a shortest path, if one of the intermediate vertices  
$t$  has  
$d[t][t] < 0$  (i.e.  
$t$  is part of a cycle of negative weight),  
$t$  can be reached from  
$i$  and  
$j$  can be reached from  
$t$ . Then the path from  
$i$  to  
$j$  can have arbitrarily small weight. We will denote this with -INF.

Implementation¶

for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        for (int t = 0; t < n; ++t) {
            if (d[i][t] < INF && d[t][t] < 0 && d[t][j] < INF)
                d[i][j] = - INF; 
        }
    }
}
