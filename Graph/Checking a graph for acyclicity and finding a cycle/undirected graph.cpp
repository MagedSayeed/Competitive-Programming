/*
Here is an implementation for undirected graph. Note that in the undirected version, 
if a vertex v gets colored black, it will never be visited again by the DFS. 
This is because we already explored all connected edges of v when we first visited it. 
\The connected component containing v (after removing the edge between v and its parent) must be a tree, 
if the DFS has completed processing v without finding a cycle. 
So we don't even need to distinguish between gray and black states. 
Thus we can turn the char vector color into a boolean vector visited.
