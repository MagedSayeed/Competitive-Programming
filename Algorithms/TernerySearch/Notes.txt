There are two Versions(cases):
The function strictly increases first, reaches a maximum and then strictly decreases.
The function strictly decreases first, reaches a minimum, and then strictly increases.
Notes: 
think (ok(md1) < ok(md2)) or (ok(md1) <= ok(md2)) or it doesn't matter
Change the underlined lines(five in total) and the ok function
To swap between versions simply swap the code inside the two conditions
